# Project Setup

## Setting Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following content:

```


PORT=8080
DB=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-mongodb-cluster-url>
NODE_ENV=production
```

start project

```
npm run dev

```

Ensure you have Node.js installed and your project dependencies are up to date.
